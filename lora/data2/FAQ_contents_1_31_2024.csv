"What is a safe way to celebrate the holidays?
","Postponing travel and staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others this year. Limit gatherings to people living in the household. If you are having guests to your home, be sure that people are wearing masks and staying 6 feet apart."
"Who should quarantine and for how long?
","<ol>
<li>If you or a member of your family has been in close contact (within 6 feet for of more than 15 minutes over a 24-hour period, even if you are wearing a mask to lower your risk of infection) with someone who has COVID-19, you should quarantine. People in quarantine should stay home, separate themselves from others and monitor their health. You should also quarantine if you provided care at home to someone who is sick with COVID-19, had direct physical contact with the person (hugged or kissed them), shared eating or drinking utensils or if someone you know with COVID-19 sneezed, coughed, or somehow got respiratory droplets on you. If you are symptomatic or waiting for a test result, you and other members of your household should quarantine. b.	Quarantine can end after 10 days if the person has not developed any symptoms. A test is not required.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Quarantine can end after seven days if the person tests negative for COVID-19 on day five, six or seven of the quarantine and has not developed any symptoms.</li>
</ol>"
What is COVID-19 & how is it effecting hospitals?,"<ol>
<li>COVID-19 is a contagious respiratory illness caused by a new Coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. People with COVID-19 sometimes have a cough, fever, feel like it's hard to breathe, or even lose their sense of taste or smell. Other symptoms include congestion or runny nose, diarrhea, headache, nausea or vomiting, muscle pain or fatigue, sore throat or chills. Symptoms range from mild to severe and may appear 2-14 days after exposure. People who have tested positive for COVID-19 do not need to quarantine or get tested again for up to 3 months as long as they do not develop symptoms again.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Hospitals are nearing capacity due to the increase in positive COVID-19 cases. Emergency rooms are being forced to bypass patients in some cases due to the lack of bed availability in hospitals.</li>
</ol>"
Where can I get tested?,"<p>Click <a href=""portal/group/health/page/covid19-testing"">HERE</a> for latest information on COVID testing in Lake County.</p>
<ul>
</ul>"
"Do I need to be retested to return to work?
","No, a negative test is not required. However, at least 10 days should have passed since the symptoms first appeared, and at least 24 hours since the last fever without the use of fever­ reducing medications and COVID-19 symptoms have improved to end the isolation."
What is the LCHD's role during the COVID-19 outbreak?,"<p><span>The LCHD Health Officer and staff are working in coordination with the Indiana State Department of Health and infectious disease specialists in local hospitals to closely follow and implement CDC recommendations for the protection of the local community. We are also readying our emergency preparedness team and coordinating with various government and non government agencies.</span><br /><br /><span>     *   Nurses and support staff are calling all people who are confirmed COVID-19 positive in order to advise self-quarantine and isolation precautions. Nurses are also contacting their high risk close contacts. Positive individuals are advised to inform all of their close contacts of their risk and advise self-quarantine. Due to the high number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Lake County, our nurses are no longer able to contact all close contacts, but are still contacting those close contacts who are high risk. For more information about who is high risk, visit </span><a onclick=""javascript:openExtWindow('https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html')"" rel=""noreferrer"" href=""javascript:void(0)"">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html</a><br /><br /><span>     *   The food safety division inspectors are inspecting take-out and drive-through restaurants to ensure adherence to all food safety guidelines. Inspectors also respond to complaints regarding any sit-down restaurants that still operate. Those restaurants will be closed down as sit-down service is in violation of the Governor’s order.</span><br /><br /><span>     *   The environmental safety division inspectors are investigating non-essential businesses still operating in Lake County. If it is a clear violation of the Governor’s order, then they can be shut down. As the Governor’s order is updated often and open to interpretation regarding essential businesses, we will work with our legal department for clarification and our legal department will follow up.</span><br /><br /><span>     *   Our emergency preparedness directors work in close contact with the District 1 emergency preparedness team, hospitals, and all local emergency teams. POD (point of distribution) sites are located in various parts of Lake County in case of medication or vaccination distribution or other emergency needs. At this time, there is no COVID-19 vaccination.</span><br /><br /><span>     *   Vital records (birth and death certificates) are currently processed by mail.</span><br /><br /><span>     *   The LCHD receives a supply of PPE (personal protective equipment) from the National Stockpile via the Indiana State Department of Health and distributes it to necessary departments and individuals according to the guidelines. Hospitals, local nursing homes, dialysis centers, home health agencies, police, and physicians who are not employed by a hospital can request PPE including masks, gowns, face shields, and gloves. PPE will be distributed depending on LCHD availability.</span></p>"
What is a close contact?,"<p>A close contact is a person who was either within 6 feet of a person confirmed to have COVID-19 for about 10 minutes or more, or had close physical contact with a confirmed case. Close physical contact includes hugging, touching, sharing household items like eating utensils, or being around a sick person coughing.</p>"
Is the Lake County Health Department open?,"<p>The LCHD is accessible by phone weekdays from 8:30am to 4:30pm. The building is closed to the public. We receive a large number of calls daily and are doing our best to answer them. If you&rsquo;re unable to reach us quickly, please be patient.</p>"
What is isolation?,"<p>Isolation is for a person who has tested positive for COVID-19. Isolation means staying home and separating from others in the household by staying in a separate bedroom and using a separate bathroom, if possible. Isolation is discontinued after 72 hours without symptoms and at least 7 days since the onset of symptoms.</p>"
Does the LCHD offer antibody testing?,"There is no FDA approved antibody test available in the United States. When an antibody test is approved, we will work with the Indiana State Department of Health to make it available in Lake County.
"
How is Lake County working with local hospitals on the COVID-19 response?,"<p>Lake County receives its national stock pile of emergency supplies, which is distributed to local nursing homes, home health agencies, dialysis centers, police officers and non-hospital employee physicians.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s requirements are different, and we determine how to prioritize based on various levels of immediate need and the availability of our supplies. Lake County hospitals receive their own supplies directly from the Indiana State Department of Health in a separate process.</p>
<p>Nurses are fielding and making 400-plus phone calls daily &mdash; either by answering COVID-19 questions from the public or calling out to track active and potential cases.</p>
<p>The nurses are also tracking all positive cases and their recent contacts to advise quarantine precautions.</p>
<p>The emergency preparedness team is attending risk management meetings and making sure that emergency supplies reach the departments in need of them.<br /><br />The county&rsquo;s food safety department is still inspecting operating drive-thru restaurants and eateries with takeout to keep the food safety. The health department is working in conjunction with the infectious disease divisions of the hospitals, she said.</p>"
Is the Lake County Health Department doing contact tracing?,"Yes, the LCHD is doing contract tracing for high risk close contacts of confirmed cases."
When will results from recent testing sites be available?,Positive results will be available from testing sites in Merrillville and Gary in approximately 72 hours via phone call. Everyone will receive results in 5-6 working days.
What would you say to people who still believe this is a hoax or believe public health experts have blown the COVID-19 outbreak out of proportion?,"<p>The spread of the COVID-19 virus must be taken seriously by all members of the community due to its aggressive nature and severe medical consequences. It is vital that each and every one of us follow the advice of health care professionals, health departments and medical institutions. Even if someone only experiences mild symptoms, they may infect high-risk individuals, such as the elderly or immunocompromised persons, whose conditions could become fatal.</p>
<p>We are all responsible for protecting our personal health as well as the health of our fellow community members and should do everything possible to reduce the spread of this infection.</p>"
"Do I have to wear a cloth mask in public, even if I feel healthy?","<p>The CDC now recommends that people wear cloth face coverings in public, even if you don&rsquo;t feel sick. This may help reduce transmission from people who are asymptomatic (people who don&rsquo;t feel sick but still have an infection). More information:&nbsp;</p>

"What if I have a pre-existing medical condition but no symptoms?
","<p>People with pre-existing conditions should make sure to take their prescribed medications regularly, receive medications by mail and avoid the pharmacy in-person when possible. They should stay active in the house, exercise or be active outdoors if the weather permits. Vavilala said it's OK to postpone regular checkups if the person doesn&rsquo;t have any active health concerns</p>"
What is self-quarantine?,"<p>Self-quarantine is for a close contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case. Self-quarantine means staying home for 14 days and monitoring for symptoms. Check your temperature twice a day and stay away from others in the home who are vulnerable. If there are no symptoms after 14 days, self-quarantine is over.  Information on symptoms of COVID-19 can be found here: <a onclick=""javascript:openExtWindow('https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html')"" href=""javascript:void(0)"">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html</a></p>"
How can I maintain a clean environment inside the home?,"<p>Use disinfectant wipes to clean surfaces, and if wipes are not available, diluted bleach.</p>
<p>Clothes should be washed daily with soap and water, but if you are unable to wash clothes daily, they should be placed in a laundry bag and tied and left in a separate bathroom used by the person with symptoms.</p>
<p>A bleach solution can be prepared by mixing 1/3 cup of bleach per one gallon of water or four teaspoons bleach per quart of water.</p>"
What is social distancing?,"Social distancing means avoiding close contact with others in order to reduce risk of spreading COVID-19. This includes trying to maintain a distance of 6 feet from others, avoiding social gatherings, avoiding nonessential travel, and practicing hygiene like frequent hand washing and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces."

Important Information about Court Appearances,"You must appear in court for all your court hearings unless told otherwise by the judge or your lawyer. It can take several months for a case to move through the court system. During that time, it is important for you to keep in touch with your lawyer and to make all court appearances until your lawyer tells you that your case is over."
Why are attorneys made available from the Public Defender’s Office?,"Under the United States Constitution and Indiana Constitution, we have an adversarial justice system. This means that one lawyer represents the State, another represents the accused. A fair adversarial system requires that the accused and the prosecution have attorneys with equal resources available to them in order to achieve both truth and justice in the courts. Accordingly, under the law as set forth in the United States Constitution, anyone charged with any serious criminal offense in the United States is entitled to have a lawyer representing them whether that person can afford a lawyer or not. "
What Is a Public Defender?,"A public defender is an attorney, who represents people charged with criminal offenses who cannot afford to hire a private attorney. Like any other attorney, a public defender has graduated from an ABA accredited law school, has passed the Indiana bar exam, and has a license to practice law. Public defenders are trained carefully through training programs and are required to complete continuing legal education classes each year. In addition, they attend local and national conferences to keep themselves current in the law and to sharpen their trial skills."
"IF I AM ARRESTED, SHOULD I TALK TO THE POLICE?","If you are arrested, you should request to speak to a lawyer and you should obtain advice from a lawyer before answering police questions. If you ask to speak to a lawyer, a lawyer will be provided for you – wait and speak to that lawyer before answering questions."
"My Felony was dropped to a Misdemeanor, but background checks are still showing that I have a felony. Why?","It appears that the state does not forward the information regarding a person's Class 6 designation from a felony to misdemeanor to anyone. This means that when background checks are done, the charges are still showing as felonies."
How do I retain the services of a Public Defender?,"If a person is determined financially unable to retain a private attorney, the courts will appoint the Lake County Public Defender's Office as the legal representative. This appointment usually happens at the first court appearance which is called an Initial Hearing."
Working With Your Attorney,"<p>It takes time, sometimes several months, for a case to move through the courts. During that time, you can do many things to assist your attorney in working on your case. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be on time for court and other legal      appointments. If you are delayed for any reason, call your attorney.</li>
<li>Provide current contact information.      Give your attorney your home and work addresses, your home, work, mobile,      and message phone numbers, and let your attorney know immediately if any      of these change.</li>
<li>Maintain regular contact with your      attorney.</li>
<li>Dress appropriately for court.</li>
<li>Give your attorney a list of possible      witnesses.</li>
<li>Give your attorney copies of all      relevant documents.</li>
<li>Do not discuss your case with anyone      other than your attorney or our office staff. Since anything you say may      be used against you in trial, you should not discuss the case with family      members, friends, other inmates, detention officers, probation officers,      in person or on the telephone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that all personal telephone and Telemate calls made from the jail <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">are recorded</span></strong>. The Prosecutor sends these recordings out to be reviewed for any information that may pertain to your case. Also, the Prosecutor has the ability to watch these recordings at any time.

"We are a not-for-profit entity (charitable, religious, educational, etc.) and have personal property, but since we receive an exemption, do we have to file a personal property tax eturn?","<p>Yes, the annual filing of a personal property tax return is still required. Indiana law states that the  property is subject to taxation until the entity follows the statutory procedures for obtaining the   exemption. Basically this means that the entity files a personal property tax return to assess the   property and then it files the exemption application as required to claim an exemption on the   assessment. The county property tax assessment board of appeals (PTABOA) then reviews the   exemption each year to determine if the property&rsquo;s use qualifies it for a full or partial exemption   or no exemption at all.</p>"
Is it possible that the benefits of the Constitutional tax cap could over-ride the benefits of the tax abatement deduction?,"<p>Yes, it is possible. The question is very case specific and would be based on the assessed value,  the size of the abatement deduction, and the tax rate for that taxing district.</p>

Could you explain how the Constitutional tax cap works with a personal property assessment?,"<p>Basically, the gross assessed value less any deductions equals the net assessed value, which is  multiplied by the tax rate for every one hundred dollars ($100) of assessed valuation, which   equals an amount due. Then the gross assessed value is multiplied by the cap rate of three   percent (3%) to arrive at an amount due. The actual tax liability is the lesser of these two   numbers.</p>"

"As of March 1, I was in the process of installing a production line in my business. This production line was not capitalized on March 1, but was included on the balance sheet as construction in process. This production line was completed and capitalized,","<p>Yes, the cost of the production line needs to be reported on the Form 103-Long. A further  explanation can be found in 50 IAC 4.2-6-1. Personal property not placed in service is defined as   property which has not been depreciated and is not eligible for federal income tax depreciation.   Construction in Process (CIP) is an example of equipment not placed in service. It is physically   there on the assessment date, but is not completely assembled and functioning. The True Tax   Value of this equipment would be ten percent (10%) of the cost of the qualified  placed in service. This would be disclosed on line 59 of the Form 103-Long.</p>"
"I own a small accounting business. In completing my personal property return, there are questions on page 1 of the return about leased equipment. On March 1, my business is in possession of a leased copy machine and a leased postage mailing machine. In re","<p>The personal property rule has a section (50 IAC 4.2-8) on leased equipment. Leased equipment  is defined as being either a capital or operating lease. A &ldquo;capital lease&rdquo; is defined as lease in   which title (ownership) to the asset will transfer at or before the end of the lease to the lessee.   These types of leases contain a purchase option and title can transfer at the end of the lease.   These can include a sales type lease, direct financing lease, and leveraged leases. An &ldquo;operating   lease&rdquo; is typically a short-term lease in which the leased equipment will remain the property of   the leasing company at the end of the lease. Based upon the information included in the question,   this would meet the definition of an &ldquo;operating&rdquo; lease since the lease term is one (1) year. In the   case of an operating lease, the lessor/leasing company that leases the equipment is the party   responsible for reporting and paying the property taxes. The leasing company will report this   leased equipment in the pools using the Form 103. In addition, the leasing company will file   Form 103-O, Schedule 1. The accounting business (lessee) will need to complete Form 103-N,   Schedule I. The purpose of filing the Form 103-N is to disclose that you are in possession of   these two leased items and that the leasing company/lessor is the owner of this equipment.</p>"
"I have two old injection mold machines that have been removed from service and
replaced with new machines. These old machines have been moved to my warehouse and are going to be sold. Do I still have to report these two injection mold machines?","<p>Yes. When machinery and equipment has been removed from service and is awaiting disposal on  the assessment date, it is valued as &ldquo;permanently retired equipment&rdquo; pursuant to 50 IAC 4.2-4-  Page 11 of 12  3(d). This property would be reported on the Form 103-Long, line 61, at its net scrap or net sale   value. In reporting this equipment, you should also file a Form 106 explaining this adjustment.</p>"
"What qualifies for the abnormal obsolescence deduction and how do I claim it on the
property tax return?","<p>50 IAC 4.2-9-3(a) defines &ldquo;abnormal obsolescence&rdquo; as meaning that obsolescence which occurs  as a result of factors over which the taxpayer has no control and is unanticipated, unexpected,   and cannot reasonably be foreseen by a prudent businessperson prior to the occurrence. It is of a   nonrecurring nature and includes unforeseen changes in market values, exceptional technological   obsolescence, or destruction by catastrophe that has a direct effect upon the value of the personal   property of the taxpayer at the tax situs in question on a going concern basis. It is important to   understand that functional obsolescence and external/economic obsolescence are market value   concepts while normal obsolescence and abnormal obsolescence are concepts used in Indiana&rsquo;s   true tax value system. These two concepts of obsolescence have entirely different functions and   should not be intermingled. Please refer to the following memos for further detail:  <a href=""http://www.in.gov/dlgf/files/090821_-_Wood_Memo_- _Abnormal_Obsolescence_and_Personal_Property_Assessments.pdf and http://www.in.gov/dlgf/files/110418_-_Wood_Memo_-_Abnormal_Obsolescence_FAQs.pdf"" target=""_blank"">http://www.in.gov/dlgf/files/090821_-_Wood_Memo_-  _Abnormal_Obsolescence_and_Personal_Property_Assessments.pdf and   http://www.in.gov/dlgf/files/110418_-_Wood_Memo_-_Abnormal_Obsolescence_FAQs.pdf</a></p>"
What is the timeframe for an assessor to change a personal property assessment?,"<p>If the taxpayer&rsquo;s personal property return for a particular year substantially complies with the  applicable laws and regulations, an assessing official or a county property tax assessment board   of appeals (PTABOA) may change the assessed value claimed by the taxpayer on the return only   within the time period prescribed in IC 6-1.1-16-1, meaning a township assessor has until   September 15 or four months after the return is filed (whichever is later) and the county assessor   or the PTABOA has until October 30 or five months after the return is filed to make a change to   an assessment without conducting a full audit. Otherwise, if a taxpayer files a personal property   return for a particular year, personal property which is omitted from or undervalued on the return  may be assessed, or its assessed value may be increased, only if proper notice is given within   three years after the date the return is filed. If a taxpayer fails to file a personal property return   for a particular year, the taxpayer&rsquo;s personal property may be assessed for that year only if   proper notice is given within ten years after the date on which the return for that year should   have been filed. These time limitations would apply to the review function of the PTABOA, but   not the appeal function under IC 6-1.1-15.</p>"
"I timely filed my business personal property return on May 15. However, on June 25, I received a Form 113/PP from the county assessor advising me that my assessment was increased from $128,200 to $142,000. The county provided an explanation of this change","<p>Yes, you can appeal this change in assessment to the county property tax assessment board of   appeals (PTABOA). This notice of appeal must be filed not later than forty-five (45) days after   the date of the Form 113/PP with the township assessor (if any) or the county assessor.  Instructions for completing this notice of appeal can be found at the top of the Form 113/PP.</p>"
"I have personal property in my possession that does not belong to me, but I do not want to report this to the assessor because I don’t want the owners to have to pay taxes on it either. Could I get in trouble for this?","<p>The Department&rsquo;s rules state that the person in possession of the personal property is liable for  the taxes on the property unless he establishes that the property is being assessed and taxed in  the name of the owner, or the owner is liable for the taxes under a contract with that person and   that person files a correct Form 103-N If the person in possession refuses to establish this, the   assessor could estimate the value of the personal property and place that assessment on the   person in possession. (See 50 IAC 4.2-2-4 for more information on this topic.)</p>"
In filing my personal property return I have reported all the equipment that is shown on my depreciation schedule. My accountant removes from the depreciation schedule the equipment once it becomes fully depreciated. If I am still using these fully deprec,"<p>Yes. The fully depreciated assets that have been written off that you are still in possession of are  required to be reported on the personal property return. It is important to understand that being   fully depreciated relates to expenses for federal income tax purposes, while Indiana&rsquo;s personal   property tax system is an ad valorem tax which remains in place while the asset is used in the   production of income. This is further explained in 50 IAC 4.2-4-3.</p>"

A &ldquo;capital lease&rdquo; is defined as lease in   which title (ownership) to the asset will transfer at or before the end of the lease to the lessee.   These types of leases contain a purchase option and title can transfer at the end of the lease.   These can include a sales type lease, direct financing lease, and leveraged leases. An &ldquo;operating   lease&rdquo; is typically a short-term lease in which the leased equipment will remain the property of   the leasing company at the end of the lease. Based upon the information included in the question,   this would be a &ldquo;capital&rdquo; lease. In the case of a capital lease, the lessee/possessor of the leased   equipment is the party responsible for reporting and paying the property taxes. These leased   CNC machines should be reported in the pools on your Form 103. In addition, you will need to   complete Form 103-N, Schedule II. The leasing company will complete Form 103-O, Schedule   II, which will disclose that the owned leased equipment is a capital lease to be assessed to the   person in possession of the property (in this case, the tool and die business). Proper disclosure of   the lease agreement on the Form 103-N and Form 103-O will lessen the possibility of a double   assessment occurring.</p>"
How are computer software costs handled? Do I need to report the software costs on my personal property return?,"<p>Computers, including the hardware and &ldquo;operational&rdquo; software, must be reported on the personal  property return. Operational software consists of the software that makes the computer hardware   function. Application software consists of the program that details the operations the computer   equipment is to perform to achieve the specific objective of the user. If the value recorded on the   books and records reflects charges for customer support services such as educational services,   maintenance, or application software that relate to future periods and not to the value of the   tangible personal property, the charges may be deducted as nonassessable intangible personal   property (to the extent that a separate charge or value can be identified). This is further discussed   in 50 IAC 4.2-4-3(f) and (g).</p>"
"If I file a Form 103-Short for an assessment date, do I have to continue using the short form or can I switch and use the Form 103-Long?","<p>Each assessment year stands alone, so any business could file the Form 103-Long; however,  smaller businesses may elect to file the Form 103-Short if they meet the requirements listed on   the form. This means it is possible  the short form the prior year.</p>"

"I file personal property tax returns in multiple counties and one county is requesting
that every taxpayer reconcile last year’s return to this year’s return by providing 
information on acquisitions and disposals. Can this county do that?","<p>No, this information is not required by statute or by the Department&rsquo;s administrative code, so a  county cannot set a county-wide policy to request it. While an assessor cannot request this   information on a county-wide basis at the time of filing, an assessor does have the responsibility   of reviewing returns once they are filed. If questions arise during that review, the assessor has the   authority to request a taxpayer&rsquo;s books and records or explanations on the information and   amounts reflected on that return.</p>"
How are Special Tools reported for Personal Property Tax Purposes?,<p>They are reported on Form 103-T. (State Form #22667) The total cost of acquisitions since the  last assessment date is valued at 30% of cost. The total cost of acquisitions prior to the last   assessment date is valued at 3% of cost. The total value is carried to Line 60 of Form 103-Long.  They are not subject to the 30% floor computation.</p>
"I have business personal property located in several townships within a county. If I send the county assessor a spreadsheet along with a cover letter requesting him/her to calculate the assessments and place them in the proper taxing district, would that ","<p>No, the personal property tax system in Indiana is a self-assessment system where the taxpayer  determines what his assessment should be, and the assessor reviews that assessment. The mailing   of a cover letter with an attached spreadsheet would not constitute the filing of a personal   property return, so late filing penalties would apply if a return is not timely filed.</p>"
I have business personal property located in several counties. Am I permitted to report all the equipment spread out through each of these counties in one taxing district for each county?,<p>No. An assessment must be filed in each taxing district within each county where property has a  tax situs.</p>
"I have an irrigation system on my farm. Is this system assessable as real or personal
property?","<p>This system is a piece of equipment and would be assessable as personal property. This would   include the pivot, the well, the power wiring, and the pumps and motors associated with the  irrigation system.</p>"
"I timely filed my business personal property return but later determined it was filed
incorrectly. Are there any provisions for “amending” a filed return?","<p>Yes. If you timely filed your original return, you may amend this return one time. This would be   done by filing another return and showing &ldquo;Amended&rdquo; at the top of the return. The amended   return must be filed within twelve months of the due date of original return. In other words, the   amended return would be due by May 15 of the following year or within twelve months of the   extended due date, if an extension was granted. A taxpayer may claim on an amended personal   property tax return any adjustment or exemption that would have been allowable under any   statute or rule adopted by the Department, if the adjustment or exemption had been claimed on   the original personal property tax return. A return that is filed late cannot be amended.</p>"
"In filing my personal property return, I’m not sure which of the four (4) pools I should
report my equipment in. Is there any guidance on this?",<p>Yes. All equipment costs should be reported in the pools based upon the depreciable life  assigned for federal tax purposes. Most equipment generally will fall into Pool #2. This is also   discussed in the personal property rule at 50 IAC 4.2-4-5.</p>
Has business personal property tax been eliminated?,"<p>No, it has not been eliminated. However, there were several legislative changes in 2014,  including the creation of a &ldquo;super abatement&rsquo; (whereby a taxpayer could get up to a 20-year   property tax abatement) and optional exemptions for qualifying new business personal property   (IC 6-1.1-10.3) and qualifying business personal property with an acquisition cost of less than   $20,000 (IC 6-1.1-3-7.2). These provisions are effective July 1, 2015.</p>"
"My dad sold me his business for one dollar ($1.00). Am I still required to report this
equipment since none of the equipment has been capitalized and depreciated?",Yes. The equipment is used in the production of income and needs to be reported. 50 IAC 4.2-4-3(e) states that equipment recorded on the books at a nominal or no value must be reported at its actual acquisition cost determined by reference to the insurable value of the equipment.
"I have several assets on my depreciation schedule which I’m not sure should be
reported as personal property or assessed as real property. Are there any guidelines to help distinguish this?",<p>Yes. Included in the personal property rule (50 IAC 4.2) is a guide intended to assist in the  identification of property as to being either real or personal property. (See 50 IAC 4.2-4-10)</p>
Why is the grain leg assessed as personal property and the grain bin that it is attached to assessed as real property?,"<p>The use of the asset is the key. The grain bin, used for storage, is classified in 50 IAC 4.2-4-10 as   real property while the legs and other loading/unloading systems are classified as part of the   machinery and equipment which is assessed as personal property. The same theory applies to   automatic feeding and watering systems in livestock or poultry buildings since their use pertains   to the operation and not the structure of the building.</p>"
"Why is the well for my house assessed as real property and the well for my irrigation
system assessed as personal property?","<p>A well for the home is assessed as a part of the one-acre homesite price which includes a well  and septic (or water supply and sewage service if in a city or town). The well is not assessed   separately but as a part of that piece of land.  All other wells are treated as personal property. The well to irrigate the field is simply a piece of   equipment that supplies water for the irrigation system. The well that provides water for poultry   and livestock is also personal property.  Occasionally, a well serves both functions &ndash; providing water for the home, as well as for   livestock or irrigation. In that case, the well would be assessed as real property in the one-acre   homesite price, and the cost of piping the water to the barn or irrigation system would be   personal property.  Deciding that one well is real property and another well is personal property because of its use is   not uncommon. The same distinction is made for electric power since some electric power has a   building-related use and is assessed as real property, while other electrical power has a use   related to the operation of equipment and is assessed as personal property.</p>"
Are there penalties if I fail to file my personal property return by the due date of May 15?,"<p>Yes. If you fail to file a return by the due date of May 15, a penalty of twenty-five dollars ($25)   will be applied. In addition, if you fail to file a return within thirty (30) days after such return is   due, a penalty equal to twenty percent (20%) of the tax determined to be due will be imposed.</p>"
"As a follow-up question, what if the taxpayer expensed the asset in the first year?","<p>This is a depreciation expense for federal income tax purposes, so the tax basis would be the   value for that asset for Indiana property tax purposes until it is retired through sale, exchange,   scrapped, etc. For example, a $25,000 asset that was fully depreciated in the first year would   have a tax basis of $25,000 for Indiana property tax purposes until it was retired.</p>"
"I have retired from farming and now cash rent all my farm land. I elected not to sell my farm equipment which is stored in two large pole barns. Since I have retired from 
farming, do I have to report and pay property taxes on this equipment?","<p>Yes. The Indiana Code states that personal property that is held, used, or consumed in the  production of income or held as an investment is assessable. 50 IAC 4.2-1-1.1(n) also states that   the asset is assessed until it is retired from service. Examples of an asset being retired from   service include the sale of the property or the conversion to personal use. While it may be   possible to convert a small tractor with a mower to personal use, a combine or other farming   equipment could not be considered a household item. The answer to some questions are fact   sensitive because it is possible that the retired farmer rented his farm land to his sons and while   the retired farmer is not using this equipment, his sons are using the equipment in the production   of income. It is also possible that the farmer continues to claim a depreciation expense on the   equipment or intends to only cash rent the farm land for one year. Until the equipment is retired   from service, it is assessable.</p>"
"I retired from farming and sold my farm and all the farm equipment except a small
tractor and bush hog mower which I use a few times a year to mow my yard. Do I still have to report this equipment on the Form 102?","<p>It is possible that this equipment would not be assessable if it is not used in a trade or business;   not held, used, or consumed in the production of income; or not held as an investment. 50 IAC   4.2-1-1.1(n) states that the asset is assessed until it is retired from service and the conversion to   personal use is one of the examples given to retire an asset. While property used solely for the   purpose of mowing a person&rsquo;s yard would not be assessable, the Department gives great   deference to local control since the determination of whether an asset meets the qualifications as   personal property would be case specific.</p>"
"The Internal Revenue Service changed the method that trade-ins are handled for
federal income tax purposes. Could you tell me what the basis of this asset would be in the following example?","<p>A taxpayer purchased a piece of equipment for $70,000. Three  years later, the taxpayer traded in the equipment for a more expensive piece of   equipment that serves the same purpose. The net book value of the trade-in was $40,000   and the taxpayer paid an additional $50,000 in cash. The bill of sale shows that the   dealer gave the taxpayer a significant discount off of the list price of the new   equipment. The manufacturer&rsquo;s suggested retail price for the new piece of the   equipment was $120,000. The dealer gave a $15,000 discount and allowed a trade-in   value of $55,000 which left a balance due of $50,000.</p>
<p>For personal property tax purposes in the State of Indiana, the new piece of equipment has a tax   basis of $90,000 (net book value plus cash boot). On the personal property return, the taxpayer   should report the basis of the new equipment at the $90,000 amount and not the list price of   $120,000.</p>"
"I mailed my personal property return timely last year to the county assessor instead of the township assessor. I just received my tax bill, and it has a $25 penalty plus the 20% of the tax due penalty. Why would I get a penalty?","<p>The Department&rsquo;s manual states that the return must be filed with the proper assessing official   (&ldquo;&lsquo;Original personal property return&rsquo; means a personal property tax return filed with the proper   assessing official by May15 or, if an extension is granted, the extended filing date...Failure to   file a return or be granted an extension of time to file a return by May 15 as required by law will   result in the imposition of a twenty-five dollar ($25) penalty.&rdquo;). Thus, the taxpayer may have   timely filed, but he filed with the wrong entity, so he did not file &ldquo;as required by law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Additionally, IC 6-1.1-3-7 states that a taxpayer shall, on or before the filing date of each year,   file a personal property return with the assessor of each township in which the taxpayer&rsquo;s   personal property is subject to assessment; or the county assessor if there is no township assessor   for a township in which the taxpayer's personal property is subject to assessment.</p>
<p>Please refer to the following map  <a href=""http://www.in.gov/dlgf/files/Township_Assessor_Referendum_Results.pdf"" target=""_blank"">http://www.in.gov/dlgf/files/Township_Assessor_Referendum_Results.pdf</a> for remaining   township assessors.</p>"
"What happens if the May 15 due date for filing a personal property return falls on a
Saturday or Sunday? When would the personal property return be due?","<p>The return would be due (or postmarked) on the next succeeding business day that is not a  Saturday, Sunday, or federal or state recognized holiday. Please see  <a href=""http://www.in.gov/dlgf/files/pdf/150102_-_Wood_Memo_-_2015_Assessment_Calendar.pdf"" target=""_blank"">http://www.in.gov/dlgf/files/pdf/150102_-_Wood_Memo_-_2015_Assessment_Calendar.pdf</a> for a current list of assessment dates/calendar.</p>"
"I have been real busy and will not be able to file my personal property return by May
15; can I request a filing extension?","<p>Yes. A written request for up to a thirty (30) day extension (to June 14) can be made to the  county or township assessor. The request must clearly state the reason for the request. This   request must be made prior to May 15. The assessing official will review the request and either   approve or disapprove the request in writing. The decision on whether or not to grant an   extension is made by the local assessing official, and he/she is not required to grant an extension.</p>"
Where do I mail my return?,"<p>The return must be filed with the township assessor, if any, or the county assessor of the county   in which the property is located. To find the address of the assessor, visit:   www.in.gov/dlgf/2440.htm.</p>"
"If I send my completed personal property return to the county assessor by mail, does the return have to be received by the assessing official by May 15 or postmarked by May 15?","<p>If you mail a personal property return, it would have to be postmarked by the post office on or  before May 15 to be considered a timely filed return. ""Postmarked"" does not mean the date   printed by a postage meter that affixes postage to the envelope or package, but must be   postmarked by the United States Postal Service as mailed on or before the due date.</p>"
"If I owned the business on March 1 and sold it six months later, would the taxes be pro-rated between me and the new owner?","<p>No, the owner of the personal property on the assessment date is liable for the taxes on that  assessment. If the sales contract contains terms which pro-rates the taxes, that is a legal   agreement between two parties but is not required by Indiana law.</p>"
Should I attach a check to the property tax return for the taxes due?,"<p>No, the tax rates will be calculated later in the year and tax bills will be mailed in time to be paid  by May 10 and November 10 of the following year. In other words, the taxes for the assessment   date of March 1, 2015 will be payable in 2016.</p>"
"I was attempting to calculate my estimated tax liability by multiplying my assessed
value times last year’s tax rate and the amount due seems unreasonable. Could I have made a mistake in the calculation?","<p>The tax rate is for every one hundred dollars ($100) of assessed valuation, so that adjustment  should be added to your calculation.&gt;</p>"
I am the owner of a small business and this is my first year to file a personal property tax return. What do I need to know?,"<p>A small business could file either the Form 103-Short or the Form 103-Long. Typically, the  taxpayer will review his depreciation schedule and determine which assets are assessed as real   property, which assets are subject to excise tax, and which assets are subject to personal property   tax. While taxpayers should refer to 50 IAC 4.2 for detailed information, examples of personal   property would include office equipment, other equipment, and signs. Only personal property is   reported on this form for taxation. While the Form 103-Short only has one pool used for   reporting purposes, the Form 103-Long has four pools. Determination of which pool should be   used is based on the federal life assigned to the asset. Once the proper pool is determined, the   cost of the assets is reported on the appropriate line within that pool based on the Date of   Acquisition. There is a 30% floor so the actual assessment is generally the greater of the actual   True Tax Value calculated from the pooling schedule or the 30% of cost calculation.</p>"
"I failed to file a personal property tax return but the assessor never mailed me blank
forms, so would the late assessment be subject to penalties?","<p>Yes, penalties would apply to a return filed late. The Department&rsquo;s rule states that the obligation   to file a return is not diminished because forms were not mailed to the taxpayer. The forms are   readily available, and it is the taxpayer&rsquo;s responsibility to obtain the appropriate forms and file   them in a timely manner.</p>"
What normally happens if I fail to file my business personal property return?,"<p>Once discovered, the county or township assessor will estimate an assessment based upon the  best information available and will send the taxpayer a Form 113/PP showing the estimated   assessed value. A person receiving a notice of assessment would have thirty (30) days to file a   return which would replace the estimated assessment or forty-five (45) days to challenge the   estimated assessment through the appeals process (see IC 6-1.1-15). This assessment will be   subject to penalties.</p>"
I purchased a business last July and want a copy of the personal property return that the prior owner filed last year. Can I obtain a copy of it?,"<p>The Form 104 is available for public inspection because it only contains the assessed value. The  Form 103, however, contains cost and sales data which is confidential under IC 6-1.1-35-9. Since   the previous owner and the current owner most likely have different federal i.d. numbers, one   entity would not have the right to view the confidential records of the other by requesting those   records from a government official. Of course, the previous owner can provide copies of those   records to anyone he chooses. Since this question could be fact sensitive if a person believes that   he should be entitled to this information and has been refused, he could request an opinion from   the Indiana Public Access Counselor. (Visit their website at www.in.gov/pac for more   information on accessing public records.)</p>"
My township assessor used to assist me with the filing of the personal property return but those positions were eliminated. Can the county assessor help me now?,"<p>Indiana&rsquo;s personal property tax system is a self-assessment system so it is the taxpayer&rsquo;s responsibility to file the return. While it is the county assessor&rsquo;s duty to review those returns <br />once they are filed, general assistance might be offered; however, each county will set its own policy on this issue based on the complexity of the issue or limited resources available to provide such services that are not required by law.</p>"
"Can I pay Administrative, Probation User Fees or Restitution Fees on-line?","<p>Yes, all Administrative Fees, Probation User Fees and Restitution fees can be paid at <a href=""javascript:openExtWindow('http://www.govpaynow.com/')""><strong><em>www.govpaynow.com</em></strong></a>.</p>"
"How can I find contact information for the various county offices (assessor, auditor, or treasurer) throughout the State of Indiana, locate forms, or learn more about Indiana’s personal property tax system?",<p>Go to the Indiana Department of Local Government Finance’s website at www.in.gov/dlgf.</p>
What happens if my child is released from Probation and I owe Probation Fees or Restitution?,"<p>A contempt citation will be filed against the child&rsquo;s parent/guardian and the case will be set for a citation hearing.&nbsp; If the fees are paid prior to the hearing, your case will be closed and your presence will not be necessary.&nbsp; Administrative Fees, Probation User Fees and Restitution Fees can be paid via Money Order or on-line at <a href=""javascript:openExtWindow('http://www.govpaynow.com/')""><strong><em>www.govpaynow.com</em></strong></a>.</p>"
Is there a minimum assessment where no tax return is required?,"<p>The State of Indiana does not have a minimum assessment where no return would be required if the assessed value was under a certain amount but the law does provide for a minimum tax bill. IC 6-1.1-22-9 (g) provides that if the tax liability on an assessment is less than five dollars ($5.00), a processing fee will be added to bring the liability up to the five dollar minimum.</p>"
"If my business moved or went out of business, and I no longer have personal property located within the county, am I required to file a “final” return and notify the assessor of this change?","<p>While Indiana law does not require it, many taxpayers believe that it is a good idea to communicate this information since the assessor has the authority to place an estimated assessment on someone who he/she believes has failed to file a return. If the assessor sends a Form 113/PP (Notice of Assessment/Change), and places an estimated assessment on someone, that person would have the right to challenge that assessment within forty-five (45) days of the date of the notice.</p>"

What if I can’t attend the scheduled hearing? What is the timeframe to file a continuance?,"<p>Effective July 1, 2012, the county PTABOA must give at least <strong>thirty (30) days</strong> notice, by mail, of the date, time, and place of the hearing to the taxpayer and the county or township official with whom the taxpayer filed the notice for review. In some situations, a taxpayer may need to request an extension of time (i.e., a continuance) because of individual circumstances (for example, the taxpayer may be waiting for some information such as an appraisal [although an appraisal is not required in the appeal process] or there may be some urgent family or work issues that must be attended to on the date scheduled for the appeal hearing). A taxpayer may request a continuance of the hearing (that is, a postponement to a later date) by filing, at least <strong>twenty (20) days</strong> before the hearing date, a request for continuance with the PTABOA and the county or township official with evidence supporting just cause why the PTABOA should postpone the hearing. The PTABOA must, no later than <strong>ten (10) days</strong> after the date the request for continuance is filed, determine whether the taxpayer has demonstrated just cause for a continuance, at which point the PTABOA either must grant or deny the taxpayer&rsquo;s request for continuance.</p>"

As a reminder, if it is after the <strong>eight (8) days</strong>, a penalty of fifty dollars ($50) will be assessed against the taxpayer.</p>"
How do I know if my new assessed value is correct?,"The assessed value should reflect the amount a willing buyer would pay for the property at the time of the assessment. When a property owner receives the notice of new assessment, the best way to determine if it is accurate is to ask if the property could have sold for approximately that amount during the valuation time period. For 2012-pay- 2013 property taxes, the assessment and valuation date was March 1, 2013. Sales from 2012 and the first two months of 2013 were used to determine this assessed value. A correct assessed value should reflect the amount a willing buyer would pay for the property during 2012 and the first two months of 2013."
What if I do not attend my appeal hearing? Is there a penalty?,"<p>If the taxpayer or representative fails to appear at the PTABOA hearing, and the taxpayer&rsquo;s request for a continuance was denied, <strong>a penalty of fifty dollars ($50)</strong> will be assessed against the taxpayer. The penalty will also be assessed if the taxpayer&rsquo;s request for a continuance, request for the PTABOA to take action without the taxpayer being present, or withdrawal is not timely filed. A taxpayer may appeal the assessment of the penalty to the IBTR or directly to the Tax Court.</p>"
What is the IBTR?,The IBTR is the state administrative tax appeals board. A taxpayer who disagrees with the PTABOA’s determination may petition the IBTR for further review.
Do I have to show up for the appeal hearing or can they review the information I submitted?,<p>A taxpayer may request that the PTABOA take action without the taxpayer being present and make a decision based on the evidence already submitted to the PTABOA. The taxpayer may make the request by filing it with the PTABOA and county or township official at least <strong>eight (8) days</strong> before the hearing date.</p>
"I think my assessment is incorrect and I am filing an appeal. Do I have to pay the full amount of my tax bill, or can I wait for the results of my appeal?
","If you have filed an appeal, you may pay an amount based on the immediately preceding year's assessment of real property if an assessment, or increase in assessment, of real property is involved. The taxes resulting from the assessment or increase in assessment are not due until After the petition for review, or the proceeding for judicial review, is finally adjudicated and the assessment or increase in assessment is finally determined."
"If I am successful in my appeal, do I get a refund, and is there interest?","Effective July 1, 2012, if a taxpayer is entitled to a property tax refund or credit because an assessment is decreased, the taxpayer shall also be paid, or credited with, interest on the excess taxes that the taxpayer paid at the rate of four percent (4%) per year."
To whom do I speak about an appeal if my township no longer has an assessor?,The county assessor is responsible for all assessment duties if you do not have a township assessor. 
So how does the appeal process work?,"Once a taxpayer has filed a written notice of appeal, the local assessing official is statutorily required to forward that written notice to the county PTABOA and attempt to hold a preliminary meeting with the taxpayer to resolve as many issues as possible. The assessing official will forward a copy of the results of the preliminary meeting to the PTABOA. The PTABOA will review the agreement (if one is reached) and may change the assessment. If an agreement was not reached or if an informal meeting was not held, the PTABOA must hold a hearing within 180 days of the filing of the appeal. The PTABOA must give the taxpayer at least 30 days notice of the hearing date. After the hearing and a decision is rendered, the PTABOA will issue a written determination. If the taxpayer disagrees with the final determination, or the PTABOA does not hold a timely hearing or give notice of the decision within 120 days after the hearing, the taxpayer may appeal to the Indiana Board of Tax Review (IBTR)."

What can jurors do to make their service more enjoyable?,"Jurors very often have to wait while important pretrial activities take place before they are assigned to a particular jury panel. Reporting jurors are encouraged to bring along books or newspapers to read during breaks. Cell phones are not permitted in the Courts Building in Crown Point or East Chicago. However, once the jury selection or trial begins, reading materials and the like are not permitted unless authorized by the trial judge."
How are jurors with disabilities accommodated?,"If you have a disability and need a reasonable accommodation to allow you to serve, the court will try to provide the services or auxiliary aids that you need. The kinds of auxiliary aids that are generally available include assistive listening devices, and sign language interpreters.
<br><br>
Any access questions or requests for assistance can be conveyed to the Jury Administrator, Bailiff or Judge in the courtroom where you are assigned."
Are the same people summoned every few years?,No. The same jurors are not automatically summoned every few years. The random selection process assures a fair and impartial juror selection process. 
Is it true that sometimes jurors are not allowed to go home until after the trial is over? Is this common?,"As a general rule, jurors go home at the end of the day and return the next morning. There are occasions on which the court will be required to ""sequester"" a jury on a criminal case during deliberations. In extremely rare instances, a jury may be sequestered during the trial itself. ""Sequestered"" means that jurors do not go home at the end of the day, but stay in a hotel, where their access to other people and to radio and television news or newspapers is limited. The judge or bailiff will inform you in advance if there is a possibility that the jury may be sequestered.
<br><br>
The expense of all meals and lodging for sequestered jurors is the responsibility of the Lake Superior Court."
What about the juror's job?,"Indiana State law prohibits an employer from subjecting an employee to penalties or termination of employment due to jury service- so long as the employee notifies the employer upon receipt of the jury summons. The question of salary and wages is a matter to be addressed between the juror and the employer.
<br><br>
In order to verify to an employer that jury service was performed, jurors may request that court staff provide them with an attendance/work slip.
<br><br>
Jurors who believe that they have been penalized by their employer due to jury service should contact the Office of the Indiana Attorney General."
What happens to jurors who fail to report?,"Any Juror who fails to report may be called in on an Order to Show Cause to explain their absence.  Any failure to report may find you in contempt of court, which is punishable by up to 3 days in jail or $100."

How long does a juror serve?,"The Indiana Supreme Court recently implemented a policy to reduce the length of service to the shortest possible term.
<br><br>
A person who appears for service as a petit juror services until the conclusion of the first trial in which the juror is sworn, regardless of the length of the trial or the manner in which the trial is disposed.  A person who appears for service but is not selected and sworn as a juror completes their service when jury selection is completed and they are released by the court.
<br><br> 
Some trials may last longer than three days. The judge or attorneys will inform the prospective jurors of the expected length of the trial."
Is it possible to report for jury service but not sit on a jury?,"Yes. In many cases, parties seek to settle their differences to avoid the expense and time demanded by a trial. Thus, while several trials may be scheduled for one particular day, the court cannot be certain until that morning, and sometimes afternoon, which cases will actually require a trial and a jury.
<br><br>
Even if not selected to serve on a jury, the juror's role is vital. Many times, it is the very presence of a jury-which signifies the trial process and an uncertain outcome-that encourages parties to resolve issues, reach a settlement, or enter a plea."
Are jurors compensated?,"Pursuant to Lake County policy and Indiana State Law, the county will pay jurors a fee of $20 for appearing for selection and $40 for each day of physical attendance on a trial."
What is the possibility that a juror will be called again for service in the near future?,"Prior to 2005, jurors had the right to defer their service if they had served in the previous year.  As of January 1, 2005, jurors can request a deferral if they have served (received payment for) jury service with in the past two years."
What about transportation costs?,<p><span>Lake County provides .40 cents per mile for each round trip made to the juror&rsquo;s court location as reimbursement for transportation costs. There is no need to keep track of your mileage.</span></p>
How are taxes billed?,"<P>Based on the March 1st ownership year, taxes are due and payable the following year in two installments.  Tax bills are mailed once a year; both the 1st and 2nd installment tax bill payment stubs are included.  Due dates are on each installment statement. Taxes not paid on or before the due date receive a 10% penalty.  Propety with a total tax bill of $25.00 or less will be billed the total due on the 1st installment.</P>"

How are people chosen to be called for jury service?,"<p>Prospective jurors are randomly selected from a combined list including Department of Revenue and Bureau of Motor Vehicles information. Throughout the year, prospective jurors are selected randomly and sent a juror qualification questionnaire. This questionnaire must be completed by the prospective juror. Those individuals who ""qualify"" for service - a US citizen and county resident; at least 18 years of age; who are able to understand and communicate in English; are not suffering from a physical or mental disability or under a guardianship because of mental incapacity; have not had their rights revoked due a felony conviction and are not a law enforcement officer (criminal trials only) must report for service as summoned.</p>
<p>On July 1, 2006, juror exemptions were eliminated statewide. This means that no automatic exemptions are available by statute. All jurors must respond to the court as to why they cannot serve and the determination as to defer a juror's service now falls completely on the Court.</p>"
Why must I serve on Jury Duty?,"The Constitution of the United States and the State of Indiana guarantee defendants in criminal cases and litigants in civil cases the right to a trial by jury. Indiana law states that all litigants have the right to juries selected from a fair cross section of the community and that all eligible citizens shall have both the opportunity and obligation to serve.	
"
Why must jurors spend so much time waiting?,The most common complaint of jurors everywhere the seemingly endless waiting.  The time you spend waiting is being used by the judge and attorneys to resolve cases.  Many cases are resolved once the parties realize that potential jurors are in the building.  The staff of the Court Administrator's Office will do their best to keep you well informed.  Your attendance is crucial to our judicial process and is greatly appreciated.
