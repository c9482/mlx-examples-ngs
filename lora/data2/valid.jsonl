{"text":"Why are attorneys made available from the Public Defender\u2019s Office?: Under the United States Constitution and Indiana Constitution, we have an adversarial justice system. This means that one lawyer represents the State, another represents the accused. A fair adversarial system requires that the accused and the prosecution have attorneys with equal resources available to them in order to achieve both truth and justice in the courts. Accordingly, under the law as set forth in the United States Constitution, anyone charged with any serious criminal offense in the United States is entitled to have a lawyer representing them whether that person can afford a lawyer or not. "}
{"text":"What Is a Public Defender?: A public defender is an attorney, who represents people charged with criminal offenses who cannot afford to hire a private attorney. Like any other attorney, a public defender has graduated from an ABA accredited law school, has passed the Indiana bar exam, and has a license to practice law. Public defenders are trained carefully through training programs and are required to complete continuing legal education classes each year. In addition, they attend local and national conferences to keep themselves current in the law and to sharpen their trial skills."}

{"text":"My Felony was dropped to a Misdemeanor, but background checks are still showing that I have a felony. Why?: It appears that the state does not forward the information regarding a person's Class 6 designation from a felony to misdemeanor to anyone.

{"text":"How do I retain the services of a Public Defender?: If a person is determined financially unable to retain a private attorney, the courts will appoint the Lake County Public Defender's Office as the legal representative. This appointment usually happens at the first court appearance which is called an Initial Hearing."}

{"text":"We are a not-for-profit entity (charitable, religious, educational, etc.) and have personal property, but since we receive an exemption, do we have to file a personal property tax eturn?: Yes, the annual filing of a personal property tax return is still required. Indiana law states that the  property is subject to taxation until the entity follows the statutory procedures for obtaining the   exemption. Basically this means that the entity files a personal property tax return to assess the   property and then it files the exemption application as required to claim an exemption on the   assessment. The county property tax assessment board of appeals (PTABOA) then reviews the   exemption each year to determine if the property\u2019s use qualifies it for a full or partial exemption   or no exemption at all."}
{"text":"Is it possible that the benefits of the Constitutional tax cap could over-ride the benefits of the tax abatement deduction?: Yes, it is possible.

{"text":"Could you explain how the Constitutional tax cap works with a personal property assessment?: Basically, the gross assessed value less any deductions equals the net assessed value, which is  multiplied by the tax rate for every one hundred dollars ($100) of assessed valuation, which   equals an amount due. Then the gross assessed value is multiplied by the cap rate of three   percent (3%) to arrive at an amount due. The actual tax liability is the lesser of these two   numbers."}

{"text":"As of March 1, I was in the process of installing a production line in my business. This production line was not capitalized on March 1, but was included on the balance sheet as construction in process. This production line was completed and capitalized,: Yes, the cost of the production line needs to be reported on the Form 103-Long. A further  explanation can be found in 50 IAC 4.2-6-1. Personal property not placed in service is defined as   property which has not been depreciated and is not eligible for federal income tax depreciation.   Construction in Process (CIP) is an example of equipment not placed in service. It is physically   there on the assessment date, but is not completely assembled and functioning. The True Tax   Value of this equipment would be ten percent (10%) of the cost of the qualified  placed in service. This would be disclosed on line 59 of the Form 103-Long."}
{"text":"I own a small accounting business. In completing my personal property return, there are questions on page 1 of the return about leased equipment. On March 1, my business is in possession of a leased copy machine and a leased postage mailing machine. In re: The personal property rule has a section (50 IAC 4.2-8) on leased equipment. Leased equipment  is defined as being either a capital or operating lease. A \u201ccapital lease\u201d is defined as lease in   which title (ownership) to the asset will transfer at or before the end of the lease to the lessee.   These types of leases contain a purchase option and title can transfer at the end of the lease.   These can include a sales type lease, direct financing lease, and leveraged leases. An \u201coperating   lease\u201d is typically a short-term lease in which the leased equipment will remain the property of   the leasing company at the end of the lease. Based upon the information included in the question,   this would meet the definition of an \u201coperating\u201d lease since the lease term is one (1) year. In the   case of an operating lease, the lessor\/leasing company that leases the equipment is the party   responsible for reporting and paying the property taxes. The leasing company will report this   leased equipment in the pools using the Form 103. In addition, the leasing company will file   Form 103-O, Schedule 1. The accounting business (lessee) will need to complete Form 103-N,   Schedule I. The purpose of filing the Form 103-N is to disclose that you are in possession of   these two leased items and that the leasing company\/lessor is the owner of this equipment."}
{"text":"I have two old injection mold machines that have been removed from service and\nreplaced with new machines. These old machines have been moved to my warehouse and are going to be sold. Do I still have to report these two injection mold machines?: Yes. When machinery and equipment has been removed from service and is awaiting disposal on  the assessment date, it is valued as \u201cpermanently retired equipment\u201d pursuant to 50 IAC 4.2-4-  Page 11 of 12  3(d). This property would be reported on the Form 103-Long, line 61, at its net scrap or net sale   value. In reporting this equipment, you should also file a Form 106 explaining this adjustment."}
{"text":"What qualifies for the abnormal obsolescence deduction and how do I claim it on the\nproperty tax return?: 50 IAC 4.2-9-3(a) defines \u201cabnormal obsolescence\u201d as meaning that obsolescence which occurs  as a result of factors over which the taxpayer has no control and is unanticipated, unexpected,   and cannot reasonably be foreseen by a prudent businessperson prior to the occurrence. It is of a   nonrecurring nature and includes unforeseen changes in market values, exceptional technological   obsolescence, or destruction by catastrophe that has a direct effect upon the value of the personal   property of the taxpayer at the tax situs in question on a going concern basis. It is important to   understand that functional obsolescence and external\/economic obsolescence are market value   concepts while normal obsolescence and abnormal obsolescence are concepts used in Indiana\u2019s   true tax value system. These two concepts of obsolescence have entirely different functions and   should not be intermingled. Please refer to the following memos for further detail:  http:\/\/www.in.gov\/dlgf\/files\/090821_-_Wood_Memo_-  _Abnormal_Obsolescence_and_Personal_Property_Assessments.pdf and   http:\/\/www.in.gov\/dlgf\/files\/110418_-_Wood_Memo_-_Abnormal_Obsolescence_FAQs.pdf"}
{"text":"What is the timeframe for an assessor to change a personal property assessment?: If the taxpayer\u2019s personal property return for a particular year substantially complies with the  applicable laws and regulations, an assessing official or a county property tax assessment board   of appeals (PTABOA) may change the assessed value claimed by the taxpayer on the return only   within the time period prescribed in IC 6-1.1-16-1, meaning a township assessor has until   September 15 or four months after the return is filed (whichever is later) and the county assessor   or the PTABOA has until October 30 or five months after the return is filed to make a change to   an assessment without conducting a full audit. Otherwise, if a taxpayer files a personal property   return for a particular year, personal property which is omitted from or undervalued on the return  may be assessed, or its assessed value may be increased, only if proper notice is given within   three years after the date the return is filed. If a taxpayer fails to file a personal property return   for a particular year, the taxpayer\u2019s personal property may be assessed for that year only if   proper notice is given within ten years after the date on which the return for that year should   have been filed. These time limitations would apply to the review function of the PTABOA, but   not the appeal function under IC 6-1.1-15."}
{"text":"I timely filed my business personal property return on May 15. However, on June 25, I received a Form 113\/PP from the county assessor advising me that my assessment was increased from $128,200 to $142,000. The county provided an explanation of this change: Yes, you can appeal this change in assessment to the county property tax assessment board of   appeals (PTABOA). This notice of appeal must be filed not later than forty-five (45) days after   the date of the Form 113\/PP with the township assessor (if any) or the county assessor.  Instructions for completing this notice of appeal can be found at the top of the Form 113\/PP."}
{"text":"I have personal property in my possession that does not belong to me, but I do not want to report this to the assessor because I don\u2019t want the owners to have to pay taxes on it either. Could I get in trouble for this?: The Department\u2019s rules state that the person in possession of the personal property is liable for  the taxes on the property unless he establishes that the property is being assessed and taxed in  the name of the owner, or the owner is liable for the taxes under a contract with that person and   that person files a correct Form 103-N If the person in possession refuses to establish this, the   assessor could estimate the value of the personal property and place that assessment on the   person in possession. (See 50 IAC 4.2-2-4 for more information on this topic.)"}
{"text":"In filing my personal property return I have reported all the equipment that is shown on my depreciation schedule. My accountant removes from the depreciation schedule the equipment once it becomes fully depreciated. If I am still using these fully deprec: Yes. The fully depreciated assets that have been written off that you are still in possession of are  required to be reported on the personal property return. It is important to understand that being   fully depreciated relates to expenses for federal income tax purposes, while Indiana\u2019s personal   property tax system is an ad valorem tax which remains in place while the asset is used in the   production of income. This is further explained in 50 IAC 4.2-4-3."}

A \u201ccapital lease\u201d is defined as lease in   which title (ownership) to the asset will transfer at or before the end of the lease to the lessee.   These types of leases contain a purchase option and title can transfer at the end of the lease.   These can include a sales type lease, direct financing lease, and leveraged leases. An \u201coperating   lease\u201d is typically a short-term lease in which the leased equipment will remain the property of   the leasing company at the end of the lease. Based upon the information included in the question,   this would be a \u201ccapital\u201d lease. In the case of a capital lease, the lessee\/possessor of the leased   equipment is the party responsible for reporting and paying the property taxes. These leased   CNC machines should be reported in the pools on your Form 103. In addition, you will need to   complete Form 103-N, Schedule II. The leasing company will complete Form 103-O, Schedule   II, which will disclose that the owned leased equipment is a capital lease to be assessed to the   person in possession of the property (in this case, the tool and die business). Proper disclosure of   the lease agreement on the Form 103-N and Form 103-O will lessen the possibility of a double   assessment occurring."}
{"text":"How are computer software costs handled? Do I need to report the software costs on my personal property return?: Computers, including the hardware and \u201coperational\u201d software, must be reported on the personal  property return. Operational software consists of the software that makes the computer hardware   function. Application software consists of the program that details the operations the computer   equipment is to perform to achieve the specific objective of the user. If the value recorded on the   books and records reflects charges for customer support services such as educational services,   maintenance, or application software that relate to future periods and not to the value of the   tangible personal property, the charges may be deducted as nonassessable intangible personal   property (to the extent that a separate charge or value can be identified). This is further discussed   in 50 IAC 4.2-4-3(f) and (g)."}
{"text":"If I file a Form 103-Short for an assessment date, do I have to continue using the short form or can I switch and use the Form 103-Long?: Each assessment year stands alone, so any business could file the Form 103-Long; however,  smaller businesses may elect to file the Form 103-Short if they meet the requirements listed on   the form. This means it is possible  the short form the prior year."}
{"text":"What are Special Tools? (tooling): Special tooling includes, but is not limited to, tools, dies, jigs, fixtures, gauges, molds, and  patterns acquired or made for the production of products or product models which are of such   specialized nature that their utility generally ceases with the modification or discontinuance of   such products or product models. It is not the machine used to manufacture the product."}
{"text":"I file personal property tax returns in multiple counties and one county is requesting\nthat every taxpayer reconcile last year\u2019s return to this year\u2019s return by providing \ninformation on acquisitions and disposals. Can this county do that?: No, this information is not required by statute or by the Department\u2019s administrative code, so a  county cannot set a county-wide policy to request it. While an assessor cannot request this   information on a county-wide basis at the time of filing, an assessor does have the responsibility   of reviewing returns once they are filed. If questions arise during that review, the assessor has the   authority to request a taxpayer\u2019s books and records or explanations on the information and   amounts reflected on that return."}
{"text":"How are Special Tools reported for Personal Property Tax Purposes?: They are reported on Form 103-T. (State Form #22667) The total cost of acquisitions since the  last assessment date is valued at 30% of cost. The total cost of acquisitions prior to the last   assessment date is valued at 3% of cost. The total value is carried to Line 60 of Form 103-Long.  They are not subject to the 30% floor computation."}
{"text":"I have business personal property located in several townships within a county. If I send the county assessor a spreadsheet along with a cover letter requesting him\/her to calculate the assessments and place them in the proper taxing district, would that : No, the personal property tax system in Indiana is a self-assessment system where the taxpayer  determines what his assessment should be, and the assessor reviews that assessment. The mailing   of a cover letter with an attached spreadsheet would not constitute the filing of a personal   property return, so late filing penalties would apply if a return is not timely filed."}
{"text":"I have business personal property located in several counties. Am I permitted to report all the equipment spread out through each of these counties in one taxing district for each county?: No. An assessment must be filed in each taxing district within each county where property has a  tax situs."}
{"text":"I have an irrigation system on my farm. Is this system assessable as real or personal\nproperty?: This system is a piece of equipment and would be assessable as personal property. This would   include the pivot, the well, the power wiring, and the pumps and motors associated with the  irrigation system."}
{"text":"I timely filed my business personal property return but later determined it was filed\nincorrectly. Are there any provisions for \u201camending\u201d a filed return?: Yes. If you timely filed your original return, you may amend this return one time. This would be   done by filing another return and showing \u201cAmended\u201d at the top of the return. The amended   return must be filed within twelve months of the due date of original return. In other words, the   amended return would be due by May 15 of the following year or within twelve months of the   extended due date, if an extension was granted. A taxpayer may claim on an amended personal   property tax return any adjustment or exemption that would have been allowable under any   statute or rule adopted by the Department, if the adjustment or exemption had been claimed on   the original personal property tax return. A return that is filed late cannot be amended."}
{"text":"In filing my personal property return, I\u2019m not sure which of the four (4) pools I should\nreport my equipment in. Is there any guidance on this?: Yes. All equipment costs should be reported in the pools based upon the depreciable life  assigned for federal tax purposes. Most equipment generally will fall into Pool #2. This is also   discussed in the personal property rule at 50 IAC 4.2-4-5."}
{"text":"Has business personal property tax been eliminated?: No, it has not been eliminated. However, there were several legislative changes in 2014,  including the creation of a \u201csuper abatement\u2019 (whereby a taxpayer could get up to a 20-year   property tax abatement) and optional exemptions for qualifying new business personal property   (IC 6-1.1-10.3) and qualifying business personal property with an acquisition cost of less than   $20,000 (IC 6-1.1-3-7.2). These provisions are effective July 1, 2015."}
{"text":"My dad sold me his business for one dollar ($1.00). Am I still required to report this\nequipment since none of the equipment has been capitalized and depreciated?: Yes. The equipment is used in the production of income and needs to be reported. 50 IAC 4.2-4-3(e) states that equipment recorded on the books at a nominal or no value must be reported at its actual acquisition cost determined by reference to the insurable value of the equipment."}
{"text":"I have several assets on my depreciation schedule which I\u2019m not sure should be\nreported as personal property or assessed as real property. Are there any guidelines to help distinguish this?: Yes. Included in the personal property rule (50 IAC 4.2) is a guide intended to assist in the  identification of property as to being either real or personal property. (See 50 IAC 4.2-4-10)"}
{"text":"Why is the grain leg assessed as personal property and the grain bin that it is attached to assessed as real property?: The use of the asset is the key. The grain bin, used for storage, is classified in 50 IAC 4.2-4-10 as   real property while the legs and other loading\/unloading systems are classified as part of the   machinery and equipment which is assessed as personal property. The same theory applies to   automatic feeding and watering systems in livestock or poultry buildings since their use pertains   to the operation and not the structure of the building."}
{"text":"Why is the well for my house assessed as real property and the well for my irrigation\nsystem assessed as personal property?: A well for the home is assessed as a part of the one-acre homesite price which includes a well  and septic (or water supply and sewage service if in a city or town). The well is not assessed   separately but as a part of that piece of land.  All other wells are treated as personal property. The well to irrigate the field is simply a piece of   equipment that supplies water for the irrigation system. The well that provides water for poultry   and livestock is also personal property.  Occasionally, a well serves both functions \u2013 providing water for the home, as well as for   livestock or irrigation. In that case, the well would be assessed as real property in the one-acre   homesite price, and the cost of piping the water to the barn or irrigation system would be   personal property.  Deciding that one well is real property and another well is personal property because of its use is   not uncommon. The same distinction is made for electric power since some electric power has a   building-related use and is assessed as real property, while other electrical power has a use   related to the operation of equipment and is assessed as personal property."}
{"text":"Are there penalties if I fail to file my personal property return by the due date of May 15?: Yes. If you fail to file a return by the due date of May 15, a penalty of twenty-five dollars ($25)   will be applied. In addition, if you fail to file a return within thirty (30) days after such return is   due, a penalty equal to twenty percent (20%) of the tax determined to be due will be imposed."}
{"text":"As a follow-up question, what if the taxpayer expensed the asset in the first year?: This is a depreciation expense for federal income tax purposes, so the tax basis would be the   value for that asset for Indiana property tax purposes until it is retired through sale, exchange,   scrapped, etc. For example, a $25,000 asset that was fully depreciated in the first year would   have a tax basis of $25,000 for Indiana property tax purposes until it was retired."}
{"text":"I have retired from farming and now cash rent all my farm land. I elected not to sell my farm equipment which is stored in two large pole barns. Since I have retired from \nfarming, do I have to report and pay property taxes on this equipment?: Yes. The Indiana Code states that personal property that is held, used, or consumed in the  production of income or held as an investment is assessable. 50 IAC 4.2-1-1.1(n) also states that   the asset is assessed until it is retired from service. Examples of an asset being retired from   service include the sale of the property or the conversion to personal use. While it may be   possible to convert a small tractor with a mower to personal use, a combine or other farming   equipment could not be considered a household item. The answer to some questions are fact   sensitive because it is possible that the retired farmer rented his farm land to his sons and while   the retired farmer is not using this equipment, his sons are using the equipment in the production   of income. It is also possible that the farmer continues to claim a depreciation expense on the   equipment or intends to only cash rent the farm land for one year. Until the equipment is retired   from service, it is assessable."}
{"text":"I retired from farming and sold my farm and all the farm equipment except a small\ntractor and bush hog mower which I use a few times a year to mow my yard. Do I still have to report this equipment on the Form 102?: It is possible that this equipment would not be assessable if it is not used in a trade or business;   not held, used, or consumed in the production of income; or not held as an investment. 50 IAC   4.2-1-1.1(n) states that the asset is assessed until it is retired from service and the conversion to   personal use is one of the examples given to retire an asset. While property used solely for the   purpose of mowing a person\u2019s yard would not be assessable, the Department gives great   deference to local control since the determination of whether an asset meets the qualifications as   personal property would be case specific."}
{"text":"The Internal Revenue Service changed the method that trade-ins are handled for\nfederal income tax purposes. Could you tell me what the basis of this asset would be in the following example?: A taxpayer purchased a piece of equipment for $70,000. Three  years later, the taxpayer traded in the equipment for a more expensive piece of   equipment that serves the same purpose. The net book value of the trade-in was $40,000   and the taxpayer paid an additional $50,000 in cash. The bill of sale shows that the   dealer gave the taxpayer a significant discount off of the list price of the new   equipment. The manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price for the new piece of the   equipment was $120,000. The dealer gave a $15,000 discount and allowed a trade-in   value of $55,000 which left a balance due of $50,000.\nFor personal property tax purposes in the State of Indiana, the new piece of equipment has a tax   basis of $90,000 (net book value plus cash boot). On the personal property return, the taxpayer   should report the basis of the new equipment at the $90,000 amount and not the list price of   $120,000."}
{"text":"I mailed my personal property return timely last year to the county assessor instead of the township assessor. I just received my tax bill, and it has a $25 penalty plus the 20% of the tax due penalty. Why would I get a penalty?: The Department\u2019s manual states that the return must be filed with the proper assessing official   (\u201c\u2018Original personal property return\u2019 means a personal property tax return filed with the proper   assessing official by May15 or, if an extension is granted, the extended filing date...Failure to   file a return or be granted an extension of time to file a return by May 15 as required by law will   result in the imposition of a twenty-five dollar ($25) penalty.\u201d). Thus, the taxpayer may have   timely filed, but he filed with the wrong entity, so he did not file \u201cas required by law.\u201d\nAdditionally, IC 6-1.1-3-7 states that a taxpayer shall, on or before the filing date of each year,   file a personal property return with the assessor of each township in which the taxpayer\u2019s   personal property is subject to assessment; or the county assessor if there is no township assessor   for a township in which the taxpayer's personal property is subject to assessment.\nPlease refer to the following map  http:\/\/www.in.gov\/dlgf\/files\/Township_Assessor_Referendum_Results.pdf for remaining   township assessors."}
{"text":"What happens if the May 15 due date for filing a personal property return falls on a\nSaturday or Sunday? When would the personal property return be due?: The return would be due (or postmarked) on the next succeeding business day that is not a  Saturday, Sunday, or federal or state recognized holiday. Please see  http:\/\/www.in.gov\/dlgf\/files\/pdf\/150102_-_Wood_Memo_-_2015_Assessment_Calendar.pdf for a current list of assessment dates\/calendar."}
{"text":"I have been real busy and will not be able to file my personal property return by May\n15; can I request a filing extension?: Yes. A written request for up to a thirty (30) day extension (to June 14) can be made to the  county or township assessor. The request must clearly state the reason for the request. This   request must be made prior to May 15. The assessing official will review the request and either   approve or disapprove the request in writing. The decision on whether or not to grant an   extension is made by the local assessing official, and he\/she is not required to grant an extension."}
{"text":"Where do I mail my return?: The return must be filed with the township assessor, if any, or the county assessor of the county   in which the property is located. To find the address of the assessor, visit:   www.in.gov\/dlgf\/2440.htm."}
{"text":"If I send my completed personal property return to the county assessor by mail, does the return have to be received by the assessing official by May 15 or postmarked by May 15?: If you mail a personal property return, it would have to be postmarked by the post office on or  before May 15 to be considered a timely filed return. \"Postmarked\" does not mean the date   printed by a postage meter that affixes postage to the envelope or package, but must be   postmarked by the United States Postal Service as mailed on or before the due date."}
{"text":"If I owned the business on March 1 and sold it six months later, would the taxes be pro-rated between me and the new owner?: No, the owner of the personal property on the assessment date is liable for the taxes on that  assessment. If the sales contract contains terms which pro-rates the taxes, that is a legal   agreement between two parties but is not required by Indiana law."}
{"text":"Should I attach a check to the property tax return for the taxes due?: No, the tax rates will be calculated later in the year and tax bills will be mailed in time to be paid  by May 10 and November 10 of the following year. In other words, the taxes for the assessment   date of March 1, 2015 will be payable in 2016."}
{"text":"I was attempting to calculate my estimated tax liability by multiplying my assessed\nvalue times last year\u2019s tax rate and the amount due seems unreasonable. Could I have made a mistake in the calculation?: The tax rate is for every one hundred dollars ($100) of assessed valuation, so that adjustment  should be added to your calculation.>"}
{"text":"I am the owner of a small business and this is my first year to file a personal property tax return. What do I need to know?: A small business could file either the Form 103-Short or the Form 103-Long. Typically, the  taxpayer will review his depreciation schedule and determine which assets are assessed as real   property, which assets are subject to excise tax, and which assets are subject to personal property   tax. While taxpayers should refer to 50 IAC 4.2 for detailed information, examples of personal   property would include office equipment, other equipment, and signs. Only personal property is   reported on this form for taxation. While the Form 103-Short only has one pool used for   reporting purposes, the Form 103-Long has four pools. Determination of which pool should be   used is based on the federal life assigned to the asset. Once the proper pool is determined, the   cost of the assets is reported on the appropriate line within that pool based on the Date of   Acquisition. There is a 30% floor so the actual assessment is generally the greater of the actual   True Tax Value calculated from the pooling schedule or the 30% of cost calculation."}
{"text":"I failed to file a personal property tax return but the assessor never mailed me blank\nforms, so would the late assessment be subject to penalties?: Yes, penalties would apply to a return filed late. The Department\u2019s rule states that the obligation   to file a return is not diminished because forms were not mailed to the taxpayer. The forms are   readily available, and it is the taxpayer\u2019s responsibility to obtain the appropriate forms and file   them in a timely manner."}
{"text":"What normally happens if I fail to file my business personal property return?: Once discovered, the county or township assessor will estimate an assessment based upon the  best information available and will send the taxpayer a Form 113\/PP showing the estimated   assessed value. A person receiving a notice of assessment would have thirty (30) days to file a   return which would replace the estimated assessment or forty-five (45) days to challenge the   estimated assessment through the appeals process (see IC 6-1.1-15). This assessment will be   subject to penalties."}
{"text":"I purchased a business last July and want a copy of the personal property return that the prior owner filed last year. Can I obtain a copy of it?: The Form 104 is available for public inspection because it only contains the assessed value. The  Form 103, however, contains cost and sales data which is confidential under IC 6-1.1-35-9. Since   the previous owner and the current owner most likely have different federal i.d. numbers, one   entity would not have the right to view the confidential records of the other by requesting those   records from a government official. Of course, the previous owner can provide copies of those   records to anyone he chooses. Since this question could be fact sensitive if a person believes that   he should be entitled to this information and has been refused, he could request an opinion from   the Indiana Public Access Counselor. (Visit their website at www.in.gov\/pac for more   information on accessing public records.)"}
{"text":"My township assessor used to assist me with the filing of the personal property return but those positions were eliminated. Can the county assessor help me now?: Indiana\u2019s personal property tax system is a self-assessment system so it is the taxpayer\u2019s responsibility to file the return. While it is the county assessor\u2019s duty to review those returns once they are filed, general assistance might be offered; however, each county will set its own policy on this issue based on the complexity of the issue or limited resources available to provide such services that are not required by law."}

{"text":"Is there a minimum assessment where no tax return is required?: The State of Indiana does not have a minimum assessment where no return would be required if the assessed value was under a certain amount but the law does provide for a minimum tax bill. IC 6-1.1-22-9 (g) provides that if the tax liability on an assessment is less than five dollars ($5.00), a processing fee will be added to bring the liability up to the five dollar minimum."}
{"text":"If my business moved or went out of business, and I no longer have personal property located within the county, am I required to file a \u201cfinal\u201d return and notify the assessor of this change?: While Indiana law does not require it, many taxpayers believe that it is a good idea to communicate this information since the assessor has the authority to place an estimated assessment on someone who he\/she believes has failed to file a return. If the assessor sends a Form 113\/PP (Notice of Assessment\/Change), and places an estimated assessment on someone, that person would have the right to challenge that assessment within forty-five (45) days of the date of the notice."}

A taxpayer may request a continuance of the hearing (that is, a postponement to a later date) by filing, at least twenty (20) days before the hearing date, a request for continuance with the PTABOA and the county or township official with evidence supporting just cause why the PTABOA should postpone the hearing.

{"text":"How do I know if my new assessed value is correct?: The assessed value should reflect the amount a willing buyer would pay for the property at the time of the assessment.

{"text":"I think my assessment is incorrect and I am filing an appeal.

If an agreement was not reached or if an informal meeting was not held, the PTABOA must hold a hearing within 180 days of the filing of the appeal.

{"text":"Is it true that sometimes jurors are not allowed to go home until after the trial is over? Is this common?: As a general rule, jurors go home at the end of the day and return the next morning. There are occasions on which the court will be required to \"sequester\" a jury on a criminal case during deliberations. In extremely rare instances, a jury may be sequestered during the trial itself. \"Sequestered\" means that jurors do not go home at the end of the day, but stay in a hotel, where their access to other people and to radio and television news or newspapers is limited. The judge or bailiff will inform you in advance if there is a possibility that the jury may be sequestered.\n\nThe expense of all meals and lodging for sequestered jurors is the responsibility of the Lake Superior Court."}

{"text":"How long does a juror serve?: The Indiana Supreme Court recently implemented a policy to reduce the length of service to the shortest possible term.\n\nA person who appears for service as a petit juror services until the conclusion of the first trial in which the juror is sworn, regardless of the length of the trial or the manner in which the trial is disposed.

The judge or attorneys will inform the prospective jurors of the expected length of the trial."}
{"text":"Is it possible to report for jury service but not sit on a jury?: Yes. In many cases, parties seek to settle their differences to avoid the expense and time demanded by a trial. Thus, while several trials may be scheduled for one particular day, the court cannot be certain until that morning, and sometimes afternoon, which cases will actually require a trial and a jury.\n\nEven if not selected to serve on a jury, the juror's role is vital. Many times, it is the very presence of a jury-which signifies the trial process and an uncertain outcome-that encourages parties to resolve issues, reach a settlement, or enter a plea."}
